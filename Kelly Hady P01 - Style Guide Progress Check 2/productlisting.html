            Jane Austen's Emma (1816) tells the story of the coming of age of
            Emma Woodhouse, "handsome, clever, and rich," who had lived nearly
            twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex
            her.
            <br />Typical for the novel's time, Emma's transition to womanhood
            is accomplished through courtship-- both of those around her and,
            ultimately, her own. As in other Austen works, education and
            courtship go hand in hand, and Emma's process of learning to
            relinquish the power of having her own way is also a process of
            falling in love. <br />However, in Emma, this classic plot is both
            complicated by and reflective of a collection of contemporary
            issues, assumptions, and anxieties that highlight just how
            "political" even the most conventional of courtship plots can be.

            Jane Austen's debut novel is a brilliant tragicomedy of flirtation
            and folly in which two sisters who represent "sense" and
            "sensibility," or restraint and emotionalism, experience love and
            heartbreak in their own separate ways. The impetuous Marianne falls
            passionately in love with the dashing John Willoughby and makes no
            secret of her affections.
            <br />Meanwhile, Elinor and the mild-mannered Edward Ferras feel a
            mutual attraction, yet neither has the directness to acknowledge it.
            When it is revealed that Willoughby is in fact an unscrupulous
            fortune hunter and that Edward is bound by a previous commitment to
            another woman, each sister's romantic hopes are dashed. As they bear
            their grief in their different ways, Marianne learns from Elinor's
            quiet restraint, while Elinor learns the value of Marianne's candid
            expression. In the end, both sisters are happily settled, having
            each developed a more balanced approach to life and love.

            Pride and Prejudice is one of the most beloved novels of all time.
            Elizabeth Bennett, the book's poverty-bound heroine has charmed
            readers with her wit and sincerity since the book was first
            published in 1813. Its hero, the handsome and wealthy Mr. Darcy,
            infuriates Elizabeth — and women readers around the world — with his
            rude arrogance, but all fall in love with him anyway.

            1814 promises to be another eventful season, but not, This Author
            believes, for Anthony Bridgerton, London's most elusive bachelor,
            who has shown no indication that he plans to marry. And in all
            truth, why should he? When it comes to playing the consummate rake,
            nobody does it better ...
            <br />—Lady Whistledown's Society Papers, April 1814 <br />But this
            time the gossip columnists have it wrong. Anthony Bridgerton hasn't
            just decided to marry—he's even chosen a wife! The only obstacle is
            his intended's older sister, Kate Sheffield—the most meddlesome
            woman ever to grace a London ballroom. The spirited schemer is
            driving Anthony mad with her determination to stop the betrothal,
            but when he closes his eyes at night, Kate's the woman haunting his
            increasingly erotic dreams ... <br />Contrary to popular belief,
            Kate is quite sure that reformed rakes do not make the best
            husbands—and Anthony Bridgerton is the most wicked rogue of them
            all. Kate's determined to protect her sister—but she fears her own
            heart is vulnerable. And when Anthony's lips touch hers, she's
            suddenly afraid she might not be able to resist the reprehensible
            rake herself <br />Bridgerton is on Netflix now!
