As a group, consolidate your style guides into one single document. This should include all the materials required of P01 and be in the form of a clear, nicely organized style guide. Submit this as a .zip file.

As a group, set up your dev environment and sync it through git. It should include your consolidated style guide in your files. Submit the link to your Git repository.
